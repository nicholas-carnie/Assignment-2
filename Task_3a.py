#Task 3: Interpretation of loop codes

print("Welcome to Task 3(a) solution.\n")        #Calls print function - Welcome message

b = 10                  #Assign the variable: Integer '10' into variable 'b'

while b < 10:           #Initilize while loop. Continues loop for as long as variable "b" is less than integer '10'
    print("Hello")      #Body of while loop. Calls print function for string 'Hello'
    b += 1              #Increases variable 'b' by integer '1'
    
#This while loop will not inititalize as the condition 'b < 10' has not been satisfied.
