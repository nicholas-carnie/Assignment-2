# â€¢ Print first 10 numbers using while loop (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...., 8, 9, 10)

x = 1                       #Assign the variable: Integer '1' into variable 'x'

while x > 0 and x < 11:     #Initialize while loop. Continues loop for as long as variable 'x' is > 0 and 'x' < 11
    print(x)                #Body of while loop. Calls print function for variable 'x'
    x = x + 1               #Sets new value for variable 'x' as 'x + integer 1'
